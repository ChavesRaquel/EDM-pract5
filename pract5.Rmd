## 1. One dimensional Partial Dependence Plot

The partial dependence plot shows the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted outcome of a previously fit model. 
 
*EXERCISE:*
Apply PDP to the regression example of predicting bike rentals. Fit a random forest approximation for the prediction of bike rentals (cnt). Use the partial dependence plot to visualize the relationships the model learned. Use the slides shown in class as model.  

*QUESTION:*
Analyse the influence of days since 2011, temperature, humidity and wind speed on the predicted bike counts.



```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
